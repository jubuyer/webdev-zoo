        The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera.
        It has a pale yellowish to dark golden fur with dark spots grouped in rosettes.
        It is adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas.
        It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and primates.
        It relies on its spotted pattern for camouflage as it stalks and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree.
        It is a solitary animal outside the mating season and when raising cubs.
