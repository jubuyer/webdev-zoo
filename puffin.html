      Puffins are seabirds that primarily live and breed in Northern Alaska. They populate coastal cliffs 
      or offshore islands, living in large colonies that can be found in deeper parts of the land. Puffins 
      have special beaks made to catch fish, which they hunt by diving into the water. They can both fly and 
      swim extremely fast, reaching speeds of up to 55 miles per hour in the air and 10 miles per hour in the water.
      <br><br>
      The beaks of puffins change throughout the year, ranging from dull grey in the winter to bright orange in 
      the spring. The bright beak color helps attract mates, leading to lifelong pairings following a mating ritual of 
      rubbing their beaks together.
