    <p>A toucan is a type of bird that has 40 different species found in South and Central America as they 
        thrive in rainforest canopies. Among them, the Toco Toucan is the most recognizable for its black body, 
        white throat, and vibrant orange bill. They range in size from 7 inches to a little over 2 feet tall.
        They live in tree hollows and are not the best fliers so they spend a lot of their time hopping along 
        in the trees. A toucan's bill (beak) is made from keratin - it helps them regulate blood flow to keep their 
        bodies cooler and quite handy for eating, mating, self-defense, and more. Toucans are among the 
        world's noisest birds and they use their bills to make tapping and clattering noises.</p>
