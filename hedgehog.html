        A hedgehog is a spiny mammal of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae.
        Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin.
        Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies.
        However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines.
        Hedgehogs roll into a tight spiny ball when threatened, tucking in the furry face, feet, and belly.
