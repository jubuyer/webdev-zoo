    <p>The elephant is the world's largest land animal. Their trunks are versatile 
        and have around 150,000 muscle units as they use them to breathe, smell, touch, grasp 
        objects, and suck up to 8 liters of water.</p>
    <p id="fun-fact">Fun fact: elephants are herbivores and spend 12 to 18 hours eating! 
        <br></br>
        Another fun fact: they use their trunks as snorkles when they swim.</p>
    <p>Elephants are known to be very smart and have incredible memory because of their 
        large temporal lobes allowing them to retrace their steps from a long migration route to 
        locate water holes. However, around 90% of African elephants have been killed due to poaching 
        for ivory - an estimated 415,000 wild elephants remain today.</p>
