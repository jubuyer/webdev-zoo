      Harp seals are a species of earless seal native to the northern Atlantic Ocean and 
      the Arctic Ocean. Newborn harp seals are called pups, or whitecoats, and have soft, white fur which
      contributes to the extremely cute appearance. Grown harp seals look very different however, reaching up 
      to six feet long and 300 pounds. 
      <br><br>
      These seals are coveted for their soft fur used in coats and other fashion items. The hunt for seals 
      has not reduced their population, as there are an estimated 4.5 million harp seals in the wild.
