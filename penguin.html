      Penguins are a group of flightless birds that range from one foot to several feet. Located
      primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, these cleverly camoulflauged birds hunt for krill, squid, 
      and other types of fishes. Penguins commonly pair off to breed, building lifelong bonds to each 
      other.

      Reliant on sea ice, penguins migrate from warmer areas of the Antarctic Peninsula to colder areas
      in order to survive. Rising temperatures combined with decreasing sea ice has caused a decline
      in the overall population of this amazing species.
