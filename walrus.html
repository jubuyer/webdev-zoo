      Walruses are large marine mammals that live around the North Pole in the Arctic area. Thick layers 
      of blubber contribute to their large size and keep them warm. Their distinct tusks can grow up to 
      30 inches long, often commercially carved and traded. Both male and female walruses grow tusks, using 
      them for fighting, climbing, and to threaten each other. Mother walruses are notoriously protective of 
      their young, making the long tusks extremely useful.

      Surprisingly, these large marine animals are fast on land, reaching the average running speed of a human 
      by running on all fours.
