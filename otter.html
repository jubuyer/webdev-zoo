        Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae.
        The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates.
        An otter's den is called a holt, or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars; females are called bitches or sows; and their offspring are called pups or cubs.
        Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities for holding breath underwater.
        Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails.
