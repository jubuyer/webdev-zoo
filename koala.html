    <p>The koala also referred to as the koala bear is a marsupial native to Australia. They have grey fur with a 
        cream-colored chest and live in the branches of trees in dry environments like forests and open woodlands.
        Their diet consists of poisonous leaves as they feed mainly on eucalyptus leaves (up to 1 kg a day), which 
        are highly toxic to most animals when ingested. Koalas do not need to drink water as their water intake 
        comes from the moisture from eating fresh eucalyptus. They have a very strong sense of smell allowing them to 
        be selective feeders when choosing the most nutrient leaves as well as detecting the scent of other koalas on trees.

    <p id="fun-fact">Fun fact: koalas sleep for up to 18-20 hours a day!

        Another fun fact: koalas have fingerprints that are unique to each koala, unlike most animals.
